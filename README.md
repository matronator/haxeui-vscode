The battery on my macbook died and I need to get it replaced to be able to work, but a battery replacement for macbook is kinda expensive and money's little tight right now.

# HaxeUI snippets

A collection of XML snippets for HaxeUI components.

Eventually, I'd like to make this full-featured extension for HaxeUI, with things like auto suggestions, Intellisense, syntax highlighting (for tag attributes on the components) and such for both XML files with views and Haxe files with logic. At the moment however, I don't have the time to learn the VSCode Extension API so I could write my own Language server, so for now it's just snippets.
